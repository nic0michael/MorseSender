## ðŸ“š Lessons

### Predefined Lessons

* You can use `#L1` to `#L9` to play `lesson1.txt` to `lesson9.txt`
* These files contain:

  * `lesson1-3`: random groups of 5 characters (callsigns style)
  * `lesson4-6`: random callsigns
  * `lesson7-9`: random English words

### Regenerate Lessons

To generate fresh content for all 9 lessons:

```
> #ML
âœ… New lessons generated (lesson1.txt to lesson9.txt).
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Examples

### Simple word:

```
> hello
H E L L O 
```

### Repeat Continuously:

```
> [sos]
S O S   (pause) S O S   (pause) S O S
```

type s to stop

### Random groups of 5 letters:

```
> {2}
M3YTZ
KQW8Z
```

### Memory:

```
> !1 de zs6bvr k
Mem1 stored.

> $1 $1
de zs6bvr k de zs6bvr k
```

### Show help:

```
> #H

âœ… Now the README shows:  
- `#H` in the startup banner.  
- `#H` in the **commands reference table**.  
- Example usage of `#H` showing the help output.  

Do you also want me to add `#h` (lowercase) explicitly in the docs, or should we just document `#H` and assume case-insensitive handling?
